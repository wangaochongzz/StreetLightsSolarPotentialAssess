# StreetLightsSolarPotentialAssess
This library is used to store data and code for evaluating the solar potential of streetlights through Street View imagery and deep learning. The operating environment used to develop the code for this library is Windows 11 and Python 3.7. 

The first folder streetlight_detection contains the streetlight header dataset, the YOLOv5 model, and the DepplabV3+ model. The streetlight_detection folder contains the streetlight head dataset, YOLOv5 model and DepplabV3+ model, the first folder streetlight_detection contains the streetlight head dataset, YOLOv5 model and DepplabV3+ model.

The second folder streetlight_location contains the monodepth2 model and the triangulation model for locating streetlights.

The third folder solar_assess contains the code for evaluating the solar radiation of streetlights using street view images.
